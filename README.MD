This project isn't intended to be innovative. The main goal is to practice working with API services.

However, this doesn't mean it's useless. It can be a helpful project depending on how you use it.

For example, by looking at the API service files in the project, you can better understand how the SerpApi service works or even learn something new about using API services.
